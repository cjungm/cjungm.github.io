###### 문제 설명

Write a function

> ```
> def solution(A)
> ```

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct values in array A.

For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:

```
 A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1 A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1
```

the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.

Write an **efficient** algorithm for the following assumptions:

> - N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
> - each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].

나의 답 : 

```python
def solution(A):
    # write your code in Python 3.6
    return len(set(A))
```
