###### 문제 설명

Write a function:

> ```
> def solution(A, B, K)
> ```

that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:

> { i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i **mod** K = 0 }

For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.

Write an **efficient** algorithm for the following assumptions:

> - A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
> - K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
> - A ≤ B.

나의 답 : 

```python
import math

def solution(A, B, K):
    # write your code in Python 3.6
    big = B//K +1 if B%K==0 else math.ceil(B/K)
    small = A//K if A%K==0 else math.ceil(A/K)
    return big - small
```
